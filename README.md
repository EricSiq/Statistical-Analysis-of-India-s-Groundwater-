## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the **STAIML Final Project**, implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The project demonstrates the application of **statistical and machine learning techniques** to analyze data, develop predictive models, and evaluate their effectiveness.

The notebook is structured to be both **reproducible** and **educational**, serving as a reference for key methodologies explored during the course.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Apply **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights.
* Implement **dimensionality reduction** (e.g., PCA, LDA, SVD, etc.).
* Train and evaluate **supervised machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, KNN).
* Assess model performance using **quantitative metrics** and **visual diagnostics**.

## 🔬 Methodology

The project workflow is divided into the following stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values and outliers.
   * Normalization and scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Descriptive statistics.
   * Correlation analysis.
   * Visualizations for trend discovery.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**

   * PCA, LDA, SVD, t-SNE, or MDS applied where relevant.

4. **Model Development**

   * Classifiers: Random Forest, KNN.
   * Hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Evaluation**

   * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
   * Visualization: Confusion matrices, ROC curves.

## 🏆 Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of the **STAIML coursework**. Gratitude to instructors and peers for guidance and support.

---

👉 This format makes your README look **professional and academic**, but still keeps readers engaged with **visual badges, diagrams, and clear structure**.

---

Would you like me to also **extract the actual plots/outputs from your notebook** and insert them into the README automatically, so it has *real previews* instead of placeholders?
